# POP Form

This repository hosts a standalone HTML form used for the "Предоперативен протокол" (POP). It is a single‑page document and can be embedded in other sites such as WordPress.

## Repository layout

The project contains a few simple files:

| File            | Purpose                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `pop-form.html` | The HTML form with TailwindCSS styling and a small script |
| `README.md`     | Project documentation                                     |
| `LICENSE`       | MIT license for the code                                   |

Open `pop-form.html` directly in a browser to view and test the form. The form currently logs submitted values in the browser console.

## Contributing
